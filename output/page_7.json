Breed today joined Supervisor Matt Dorsey, Port of San Francisco Executive Director Elaine Forbes, Golden State Warriors President & Chief Operating Officer Brandon Schneider, project partners, and other City and community leaders to celebrate the opening of Bayfront Park, a 5.4-acre open space located between Chase Center and San Francisco Bay. The newest attraction in San Francisco’s Central Waterfront designed to be resilient to climate change, features open lawns, a section of the Bay Trail, multiple plazas, and numerous trees and native plants. “With the opening of Bayfront Park, we have reached another exciting milestone in our efforts to create a Mission Bay that is a thriving neighborhood with great open spaces, new housing developments, as well as world renowned health centers and sports institutions,” said Mayor London Breed . “I am thrilled to see this area transform from what was once a strip of dirt to become such an amazing park for residents and visitors to enjoy. I want to thank our development partners, supporting organizations, and the local community for partnering with the City to make this project a reality.” Part of the original Mission Bay Master Plan, Bayfront Park sits along the eastern edge of Mission Bay at 16th Street and Terry A. Francois Boulevard on what had been an under-utilized former maritime industrial tract. The park features many native plants, including coastal scrub found along the Bay and bioretention gardens that manage stormwater runoff. The site where the park sits was elevated to provide a robust buffer to from sea level rise and coastal surge. The project integrates with and improves access to adjacent open spaces: Agua Vista Park and Mariposa Bayfront Park to the south/southwest, and the previously completed portion of Bayfront Park to the north. To help reflect the site’s maritime industrial heritage, the park was awarded a large quantity of reclaimed steel from the old Bay Bridge to create shade structures and other site furnishings, and to use in other elements of the park. \"Bayfront Park is a game-changer for the Mission Bay community, creating a vibrant space that fosters connections and celebrates our diverse culture,” said District 6 Supervisor Matt Dorsey . “This highly anticipated park will not only serve as a dynamic hub for recreation and events but will also provide a stunning backdrop for the Chase Center and surrounding businesses at Thrive City, enriching the Eastern Waterfront for both residents and visitors. It truly embodies San Francisco’s spirit of innovation and community engagement.\" “Bayfront Park is a glorious addition to the waterfront,” said Port of San Francisco Executive Director Elaine Forbes . “This beautiful park has elements of the area's maritime industrial past with a graceful design that makes it resilient to sea level rise in the future. We are excited this park will join the Port's many memorable and magical public spaces.” Bayfront Park was contemplated as part of the Mission Bay South Redevelopment Plan, which was approved in 1998. Since then, Mission Bay has grown into a vibrant neighborhood that is home to many world-renowned institutions, including the University of California San Francisco hospitals and medical centers and Chase Center, home of the seven-time NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. Since development of Mission Bay began, the area has seen the addition of more than 6,200 housing units, with over 1,600 of them affordable. Mission Bay also has approximately 6 million square feet of commercial and retail space and over 40 acres of parks and open spaces that serve residents and visitors. The park was developed by Mission Bay Development Group, in partnership with the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII) and will be owned and maintained by the Port of San Francisco. The design of the park was led by Mission Bay Development Group and Surfacedesign Inc, in close collaboration with OCII, the Port, San Francisco Public Works, the Mission Bay Citizens Advisory Committee, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), and representatives from the broader waterfront community. Future plans include the addition of a restaurant or concession area in the park, which will help activate the area. “We are delighted to present the completed Bayfront Park to the Mission Bay community,” said OCII Executive Director Thor Kaslofsky .“ The park is a waterfront oasis and the largest park in the overall 40+ acre park system in Mission Bay. It adds to the many open space amenities OCII has built and managed in Mission Bay and the eastern waterfront offering the public, recreational activities and beautiful views of the San Francisco Bay. Bayfront Park’s central location and connections with existing Muni T-Third Street light rail service, future ferry service and the Bay Trail pedestrian and bicycle network will make it a new favorite for neighbors and visitors alike.” “The opening of Bayfront Park will significantly enhance the experience for all who visit Chase Center and Thrive City,” said Warriors President & Chief Operating Officer Brandon Schneider . “The Warriors are committed to making San Francisco and the Mission Bay neighborhood a vibrant, world-class destination and we are thrilled to see Bayfront Park add to that overall vision. We are proud to have hosted nearly five million fans at over 400 events since Chase Center’s opening, creating an estimated $4.2 billion in economic impact for San Francisco, and we look forward to partnering with the city and local community organizations to expand our offerings.” Bayfront Park is the latest in a series of new parks that have opened along or near the San Francisco Waterfront in the last four years. To the north, Tunnel Tops and Battery Bluffs in the Presidio and Francisco Park near Ghirardelli Square opened in 2022. China Basin Park across McCovey Cove from Oracle Park opened in April of 2024. To the south, Crane Cove Park opened in 2020 and India Basin Shoreline Park, a 10-acre open space on the Southeastern Waterfront, opened this past Saturday. “We’re so excited for the public to be able to enjoy Mission Bay’s signature waterfront park, and so grateful to Mayor Breed, Port Director Forbes and Supervisor Dorsey and all the City departments for their leadership and hard work to open the park so promptly after we completed construction,” said Seth Hamalian, Managing Principal of FOCIL-MB, LLC , master developer of the Mission Bay project. ### Departments Office of the Mayor Port Office of Community Investment & Infrastructure You must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.

  "content": "About SF.gov | San Francisco Skip to main content English Español 中文 Filipino About this website SF.gov is a single site for many departments and public bodies that make up the City and County of San Francisco. We’ve centralized the website to make it more accessible and save taxpayers money. We're working to connect services to make it easier to find what you need. SF.gov is run by the Digital and Data Services team , part of the City’s General Services Agency . History Since SF.gov launched in 2018, we’ve added departments, commissions, public bodies and committees from across the City. During the Covid pandemic millions of people across the US came to SF.gov. The website was a source of clear information on the virus and how San Francisco was managing the spread. In 2022, we moved 70 departments and public bodies to SF.gov. The site centralizes more information and services for you. Get involved Help us make this website better.

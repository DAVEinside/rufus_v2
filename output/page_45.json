At any polling place, voters may choose to receive an official ballot in English and Chinese, Filipino, or Spanish, and facsimile ballot in Burmese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, or Vietnamese. Bilingual poll workers are available to provide in-person language assistance at many polling places. Translation in hundreds of languages, including American Sign Language, and curbside service are available at any polling place. To find your polling place, check the back of your Voter Information Pamphlet or use the Voter Portal . Your name will only be on the roster of voters at your assigned polling place. If you go to another polling place instead, your name will not be on the roster. You can still vote a provisional ballot there, but it may not list all the contests as the ballot at your assigned polling place. In-person voting steps 1. Check in with an elections worker on site Provide your name and address to the elections worker with the roster. 2. Make ballot language and format choices If you have no preference, you will get a paper English/Chinese ballot. 3. Go to a ballot-marking area Take your voting materials to a voting booth or accessible voting station. 4. Cast your ballot Insert your ballot into the scanning machine at your polling place. Or, if you received a return envelope, insert your ballot into the envelope. Fill out the envelope and drop it in a ballot box. On your way out, pick up an “I Voted!” sticker and wear it proudly! In general, you don't need to show identification to vote. Only voters who did not provide identification when registering need to either show it or cast a provisional ballot. Accessible services Accessible entrances Most polling places are accessible. To confirm accessibility of your polling place, check the back of your Voter Information Pamphlet. Accessibility tools Every voting site has page magnifiers, pen grips, seated voting, and wheelchair accessible voting booths. Every site also has an accessible ballot-marking device with audio and touchscreen ballots. Personal assistants You can ask a poll worker for help marking your ballot. You can also bring 1 or 2 people (but not your employer or union representative) to help you. Remember, no one can make voting decisions for you. Curbside voting To vote “curbside”, call 415-554-4375 or ask someone to enter the voting site to make the request for you. An elections worker will bring your ballot outside. Multilingual help Our elections workers and interpreters speak hundreds of languages! At all voting sites, we provide ballots and other election materials in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino.

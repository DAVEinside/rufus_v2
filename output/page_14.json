The acquisition of the property $1.75 million property was supported by a $1.5 million grant secured through a competitive request for proposals process through the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD). “Supporting our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities requires collaboration, vision, and the appropriate funding. We are proud to have provided the financial support for the acquisition of 616 Minna Street because we know what this space means for so many people who will be able to access the services they need, stay close to home, and remain connected with their community,” said Mayor London Breed . “I thank the staff at Bayanihan Equity Center for all they do for residents across San Francisco and look forward to seeing the great work they will continue to do for years to come.” “For providing welfare to Filipino World War II veterans and their families, and for educating younger generations of Filipino Americans about our proud history, the Philippine Consulate expresses its profound gratitude to the Bayanihan Equity Center for keeping the flame of our veterans’ heroism alive and well into the modern times,” Philippine Consul General Neil Ferrer said.” My sincerest appreciation also goes to Mayor London Breed and the City Government for their support to the BEC and other Filipino American organizations in San Francisco.” Once open in January 2025, 616 Minna Street will serve as Bayanihan Equity Center’s new centralized facility providing clients with community outreach and education programming, as well as case management services in areas related to affordable housing, immigration, transportation, and food assistance.

Today, we have a strong partner with our local government that understands that stable nonprofits are better positioned to sustain their programs and services especially to the growing population of seniors in San Francisco,” said Luisa M. Antonio , BEC Founding Member & Executive Director. “BEC has been a proud contractor for the City for a quarter of a century, and we are thrilled to move into our new home to serve the community for decades to come.” Located in the South of Market neighborhood between 7th and 8th Street, 616 Minna Street is a 6,490 sq. ft. two-story vacant building with an ADA compliant entrance that allows individuals in wheelchairs and walkers to conveniently enter and exit the building.

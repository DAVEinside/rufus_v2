By verifying the status, voters can ensure their ballot has been received and accepted for counting, giving them confidence that their vote will be included in the official election results. Voters can track their ballots through the Department of Elections' Voter Portal at sfelections.gov/voterportal . By selecting the “Track My Ballot” tab, voters can monitor the journey of their ballots through key stages: when the ballot is mailed out, when it is received by the Department, and when it is counted. Voters can also visit the California Secretary of State's website at WheresMyBallot.sos.ca.gov to sign up for automatic email, SMS (text), or voice call notifications regarding the status of their ballot. “We encourage voters to take a proactive approach by checking the status of their ballots,” said Director John Arntz. “Any voter with questions about receiving or returning their ballot should not hesitate to contact the Department of Elections directly. We are the most reliable source for up-to-date information on how to participate in the upcoming election. Whether it’s confirming the receipt of a ballot or requesting a replacement ballot, we are here to help every step of the way.” The Voter Portal will also alert voters if there is an issue preventing the Department from counting their ballot, such as a missing signature on the return envelope. The portal explains the reason for the issue, the steps required to resolve it, and provides a link to the necessary form. Once a voter submits the corrected information and the Department processes it, the portal will notify the voter when the ballot has been accepted for counting. As vote-by-mail ballots are not forwardable by the U.S. Postal Service, those who plan to be out of town or who have changed their mailing address should notify the Department as soon as possible by calling (415) 554-4375, emailing sfvote@sfgov.org , or visiting sfelections.gov/voterportal , to avoid delays in receiving their ballots. Any local voter who does not receive their ballot packet by October 11 is urged to contact the Department of Elections for assistance. Important Reminders for Voters : Mail Early : Voters are encouraged to mail their completed ballots as soon as possible to avoid postal delays. Verify Signature : Be sure to sign the return envelope before mailing your ballot. Missing or mismatched signatures can lead to delays in processing your ballot or require additional steps for verification. Drop-off Locations : Ballots can also be dropped off at any official ballot drop box or the City Hall Voting Center. For locations, visit sfelections.org/ballotdropofflocations . Contact Us : If you encounter issues or have questions about your ballot status, contact the Department of Elections at (415) 555-4375 or via email at sfvote@sfgov.org . ### Department of Elections City and County of San Francisco 1 Dr. Carlton B.

In May of 2018, the Board of Supervisors passed Ordinance No. 128-18 requiring the Department of Elections to implement Proposition N in several specific ways. In October of 2021, the Board of Supervisors passed Ordinance No. 206-21 , making Proposition N permanent and clarifying that it covered Board of Education recall elections. A local Superior Court judge ruled Prop N was unconstitutional in July 2022. However, later that year, a California Court of Appeal ruled that Prop N was in fact permissible under the state constitution and the City Charter. On August 8, 2023, a California Court of Appeal upheld San Francisco’s non-citizen voting program. The decision permits non-citizen parents of children residing in San Francisco to continue to vote in San Francisco Board of Education Elections. Get help Department of Elections 1 Dr. Carlton B.

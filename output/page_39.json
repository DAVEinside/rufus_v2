You can still play a part in elections! Elections Ambassador Program If you are a San Francisco High School student, you can apply to serve as an Elections Ambassador during California’s annual High School Voter Education Weeks. During the last two weeks in April and September each year, High School Elections Ambassadors work to promote voter registration and civic engagement in their communities. All Ambassadors must first attend an in-person 90 minute training workshop. After completing the workshop, each Ambassador creates and implements an outreach plan to pre-register eligible youth (16 and 17 years old) and register eligible adults to vote. If you are interested in serving as a Fall 2024 High School Elections Ambassador, please complete and submit the online program application . The application period for the Fall 2024 High School Elections Ambassador program is July 30 – August 28, 2024. All successful Elections Ambassador program participants receive a participation certificate signed by the Mayor of San Francisco, distinguished community service program hours to include on their college applications, and gain valuable community outreach experience with the San Francisco Department of Elections. Voter pre-registration If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can complete a paper or online voter registration form now. On your 18th birthday, we will activate your voter record and send a confirmation letter. We will also start mailing you official election materials. Poll Worker Service If you will be at least 16 years old by the next Election Day, you can apply to serve as a poll worker. Poll worker service looks great on a college application or resume. You will also receive a stipend up to $245. To apply, complete the High School Poll Worker Application .

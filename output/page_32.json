Voters have several secure options for returning their ballots, including mailing them or delivering them in person.” Voters may choose to return their vote-by-mail ballot using any of the following methods: By Postal Mail : San Francisco’s ballot return envelopes are postage-paid, so no stamp is required when returning the ballot through USPS. For the ballot to be counted, the envelope must be signed by the voter, postmarked by Election Day, November 5, 2024, and received by the Department within a week after Election Day. To find a convenient USPS box, voters can visit usps.com/locator . To an Official Ballot Drop Box : All 37 official ballot drop boxes in San Francisco are locked, clearly marked, and available 24 hours a day until 8 p.m. on Election Day, November 5. Department staff and personnel from the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department make regular collections from all drop boxes. To find a convenient drop-off location, voters can visit sfelections.gov/ballotdropoff . At an In-Person Voting Site : All 501 neighborhood polling places in San Francisco will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, November 5. Additionally, the City Hall Voting Center will be open and staffed with multilingual representatives every day until Election Day. For more information about voting in person, voters can visit sfelections.gov/inpersonvoting. Voters can track the status of their vote-by-mail ballot and confirm its acceptance for counting at sfelections.gov/voterportal . The online Voter Portal also provides notifications of any issues preventing ballot acceptance (for example, an unsigned ballot envelope), most of which can be easily resolved by the voter. For any questions regarding registration and voting, voters are encouraged to contact the Department at (415) 554-4375, email sfvote@sfgov.org , or visit the Department’s office in City Hall, Room 48. ### Department of Elections City and County of San Francisco 1 Dr. Carlton B.
